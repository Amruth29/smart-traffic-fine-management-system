# Smart Traffic Fine Management System (STFMS)

A comprehensive web-based traffic fine management system designed for Sri Lanka's traffic police department. This system streamlines the process of issuing, managing, and paying traffic fines through a modern, user-friendly interface.

## üöÄ Project Overview

The Smart Traffic Fine Management System is a full-stack web application that digitizes the traditional traffic fine management process. It provides separate interfaces for different user roles including Traffic Police Officers, Drivers, Administrators, and Motor Traffic Department officials.

### Key Features
- **Multi-role Authentication System** - Separate dashboards for different user types
- **Real-time Fine Issuance** - Traffic officers can issue fines instantly
- **Online Payment Processing** - Drivers can pay fines online
- **Comprehensive Analytics** - Detailed reports and charts for all stakeholders
- **Revenue License Verification** - Integration with vehicle registration data
- **Past Fine History** - Complete driver violation history tracking
- **Responsive Design** - Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Backend Technologies
- **PHP 8.0+** - Server-side scripting language
- **MySQL/MariaDB** - Relational database management
- **Apache/Nginx** - Web server

### Frontend Technologies
- **HTML5** - Markup language
- **CSS3** - Styling with custom animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Client-side functionality

### Development Tools
- **phpMyAdmin** - Database administration
- **Git** - Version control
- **XAMPP/WAMP** - Local development environment

## üìä Database Schema

The system uses a well-structured MySQL database with the following main tables:

### Core Tables
- **`admins`** - System administrators
- **`driver`** - Driver information and credentials
- **`tpo`** - Traffic Police Officers
- **`mtd`** - Motor Traffic Department officials
- **`issued_fines`** - Fine tickets issued to drivers
- **`fine_tickets`** - Available fine provisions and amounts
- **`revenue_license`** - Vehicle registration data

### Key Relationships
- Foreign key constraints between `issued_fines` and `driver`/`tpo` tables
- Unique constraints on email addresses and license IDs
- Auto-incrementing primary keys for efficient data management
